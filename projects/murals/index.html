      <h3>Technically speaking</h3>
      <p>In the general spirit of the project, webpage was implemented from scratch without frameworks or third-party libraries. The gallery is dynamically built on the client and data are fetched from a single JSON. User preferences, layout, responsiveness, gallery view - all managed in JavaScript.</p>
      <p>The project was developed progressively: the main goal was to ship a working good enough version fast and cheap sacrificing nonessential functionality to meet the constraints. This means that there are things that can be improved and added. This also means this project went from idea to web in around two days including time for taking and editing first batch of photographs, and researching.</p>
