      <p>Exa is an embeddings-based search engine built by a San Francisco based team. This is a quick concept redesign of its home page to increase the number of API users.</p>

      <p>The entire page is designed to not waste the time of users. At the beginning of the page, there is a brief introduction and an immediate invitation to test out the API or search:</p>

      <p>Simplified search widget illustrates the power of Exa and invites users to try it out:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The main page consists of blocks, each with a clear function. The blocks contain cards with integration methods, features, or reviews. Whenever possible, the cards provide comprehensive information on the topic, otherwise they lead to such information.</p>
      <p>To convey care for the user, banners and cards with offerings of help are scattered throughout the page:</p>

      <p>Website adapts nicely to small screens:</p>

        <div class="scrollable-gallery-curtain"></div>
        <figure class="scrollable-gallery">

      <p>A combination of illustrations and icons is used to accompany text on the page.</p>
      <p>I sketched out the overall direction in Figma, then went to design the whole thing in code as it is the best way to design webpages. While the whole page was made with vanilla HTML and CSS, the illustrations were made and animated with Blender and Three.js. As such, to account for disabled Javascript or reduced animation, there are static placeholders:</p> 
      <figure class="three-cols narrow">
        <img class="cols-1" src="static/exa-redesign/pillar.png" alt="Redesigning Exa's website" />
        <img class="cols-1" src="static/exa-redesign/rag.png" alt="Redesigning Exa's website" />
        <img class="cols-1" src="static/exa-redesign/dataset.png" alt="Redesigning Exa's website" />
      </figure>
      <p>The pillar was adapted from the old design with some stylistic changes like more realistic look, detailed wireframe, and less prominent vertices. Modeled in 3d in Blender, it can be animated and manipulated with code on the page. The ionian-like pillar is a strong metaphor for human knowledge reminding of the Ancient Greek culture and the Library of Alexandria:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img src="static/exa-redesign/pillar-redesign.png" alt="Redesigning Exa's website" />
      </figure>
      <p>Strings of binary numbers represent the human knowledge transformed into machine knowledge. They also remind of embeddings, streams of data, and datasets. The curved lines represent messy, raw knowledge, while the straight lines represent ordered knowledge -- illustrating what Exa does.</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img src="static/exa-redesign/exa-transform.png" alt="Redesigning Exa's website" />
      </figure>
      <p>Similar to the pillar, strings are 3d so that they can animated in code. Three.js, for instance, natively supports this sort of objects without the need for Blender meshes.</p>
      <p>Icons:</p>
