      <p class="typograph">This is a concept redesign for Telegram's Android app. It was made in 48 hours, or so. The main goal was to update existing elements based on Material Design 3 guidelines, while maintaining app's core essence and lightweight feel. Along the way, I made some icons and rewrote some interface text. Almost all interface elements are purposefuly based on Material Design 3 kit. However, due to Telegram's brain-wrinkling complexity and functionality, some elements had to be designed from scratch or from significantly modified system elements.</p>
