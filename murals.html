      <p><a href="https://otaniyoz.github.io/murals/">Murals</a> is an effort to capture and document art in the streets so people can explore and be inspired by places and artists in cities. Born from seeing familiar artworks being censored or removed, the website puts artists and their work back in the spotlight:</p>
     <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/desktop.webp" alt="Murals" />
      </figure>
      <p>Artworks are displayed on a single long page and are lazy loaded on scroll. You can filter by artist, location, genre, object, and year. Censored or removed artworks are desaturated and dimmed. That's essentially it. This way, interface doesn't stand in the way of a user:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/removed.webp" alt="Murals" />
      </figure>
      <p>You can expand an artwork into fullscreen with a click, with additional information displayed:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/expanded.webp" alt="Murals" />
      </figure>
      <p>Interface supports russian and english languages; it also adapts to dark and light theme preferences, and screen dimensions:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/mobile.webp" alt="Murals" />
