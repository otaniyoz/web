      <p><a href="https://otaniyoz.github.io/murals/">Murals</a> is an effort to capture and document the art in the streets so people can explore and be inspired by places and artists in the cities. Born in slight frustration from seeing my favourite artworks being censored or removed, the website puts artworks and artists back in the spotlight:</p>
     <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/long.webp" alt="Murals" />
      </figure>
    </section>
    <section class="cols-12">
      <h3 class="cols-12">Design</h3>
      <p>Murals is intentionally simple. You can filter artworks by artist, location, genre, objects, and year. That's essentially it. This way you can explore without the obstructions of interface.</p>
      <p>All artworks are displayed on a single long page and lazy loaded on scroll. Censored or removed artworks are desaturated and dimmed:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/removed.webp" alt="Murals" />
      </figure>
      <p>Artworks can be expanded into fullscreen on click, with additional information displayed for some of them:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/expanded.webp" alt="Murals" />
      </figure>
      <p>And of course, the website adapts to your theme preferences and display dimensions:</p>
      <figure class="narrow">
        <img loading="lazy" src="static/murals/mobile.webp" alt="Murals" />
