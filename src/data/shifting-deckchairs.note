On shifting the deckchairs
There is a saying often used to describe an ultimately futile action: 'Shifting the deckchairs on the Titanic.' The rationale is straightforward: the whole ship is going down, you are going down, -- why bother rearranging the deckchairs?
Yet, imagine being stuck on one of those unfortunate liners. There are no lifeboats left and the water surrounding the ship is arctic cold and full of hostile and hungry creatures. There is no way to save the day or yourself for that matter, and no help will come in time -- all things considered, you are doomed.
You are not dead yet, but you will be: there is nothing you can do to change the outcome of the situtation, but is there anything you can do in this situation? Silly as it might have sounded initially, shifting the deckchairs on a sinking ship might just be the soundest thing to do when you are stuck on that ship.
